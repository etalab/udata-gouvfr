Logo is a Danish toy production company best known for the manufacture of toys consisting mostly of interlocking plastic bricks.

Sometimes your logo is mostly white and can cause disruption in the design.
Because we can't blame anything or anyone for being too white, we came up with a solution : we build a wall around it.

`.logo` is a very simple utility that adds padding, white background and grey border around logos for consistent display.


```logo.html
<div class="logo"><img src="..." /></div>
```
*/

.logo {
    background: white;
    border: 1px solid @grey-50;
    padding: @spacing-sm;

    img {
        max-width: 100%;
    }

    @media @query-md {
        max-width: 140px;
    }
}
